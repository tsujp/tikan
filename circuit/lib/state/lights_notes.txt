2024/02/07:
  - No recursion until Q3 2024 since the interface is not completely updated yet and no aarch64
    version is available for local macOS testing meaning it's very, very slow to incrementally
    test and try things out.
  - It looks like (to me, as only a mildly educated guess) the semi-new recursive proof API
    function `std::verify_proof` automatically puts the aggregation into the solved witness?
    If that's true how does that work...? For learning and curiosity.

[[ATTEMPT 1]]:

- Make `Game` public state only.
- Add `bbs` to `Turn` which is private player state.
    - Previously this checked `Game.bbs` to make sure a piece exists where a player
      says it does, how to make sure a player does not lie on the input now? As in,
      a player could just arbitrarily change their `Turn.bbs`.
- Add checks that pieces only move along the lit areas.

[[PROTOCOL]]:

1. White state commits to the start board, as does black (this can be done automatically by the frontend).
    - OR the start of the game is all public state so we have a known base to go off of and then
      subsequent moves can be blinded.
    - 5 Feb @ 17:47, now thinking have the public state but each player goes "ok" and that ok is them
      removing their _stuff_ from it and committing against that board so from then on
      each player can be sure the initial bitboards are correct.
2. Each turn includes current state commitment, as well as previous to prevent lying
  about their bbs this turn.
